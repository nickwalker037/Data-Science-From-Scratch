# Model - a specification of a mathematical (or probabilistic) relationship that exists between different variables

# Machine Learning - refers to creating and using models that are learned from data
    # - can also be called predictive modeling or data mining
# Ex.
    # - Predicting if an email is considered spam or not
    # - Predicting whether a credit card transaction is fraudulent
    # - Predicting which advertisement a shopper is most likely to click on
    # - Predicting which football team will win the super bowl

# 4 Model Types:
    # Supervised Model - There is a set of data labeled with correct answers to choose from
    # Unsupervised Model - There are no such labels
    # Semisupervised Models - Only some of the data are labeled
    # Online Models - The model needs to continuously adjust to newly arriving data

# in most cases, we will choose a parameterized family of models and then use data to learn parameters that are in some way optimal
