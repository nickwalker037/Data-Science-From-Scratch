# ----- FEATURE EXTRACTION AND SELECTION ----- # 

# As discussed before:
# when your data doesn't have enough features, your model is likely to underfit
# when your data has too many features, it's easy to overfit
# But what are features and where do they come from?
# FEATURES: are whatever inputs we provide to our model
